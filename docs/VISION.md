# ARCHIVIUM

## Digital Infrastructure for Real Estate Legacy

> We do not list properties.  
> We preserve assets.

ARCHIVIUM is a digital system conceived as an architectural archive for high-value real estate assets.

It rejects urgency, promotion, and trend-driven interfaces.  
It operates on principles of permanence, hierarchy, and structural clarity.

---

## Core Thesis

Real estate is not content.  
It is infrastructure.

ARCHIVIUM treats every asset as a record with:

- Provenance
- Metadata
- Temporal continuity

The interface behaves like an archive, not a marketplace.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Silence

Information density without visual noise.

### Structure

Grids, rhythm, and hierarchy are explicit and visible.

### Permanence

Design decisions are made to age well, not to impress quickly.

## Typography System (Fontsource Only)

### Serif — Canela

Source: `@fontsource/canela`

Used for:

- Primary statements
- Section titles
- Asset names

Canela provides editorial gravity and architectural presence.

---

### Sans — Söhne

Source: `@fontsource/soehne`

- Body text

## The User

ARCHIVIUM is designed for:

- Patrimonial investors
- Legal institutions
- Architects and developers
- Asset custodians

The system assumes attention, literacy, and patience.

---

## What ARCHIVIUM Is Not

- Not a listing site
- Not a lead funnel
- Not promotional design
- Not trend-driven UI

ARCHIVIUM rewards attention.  
It does not seek it.

---

## Success Criteria

ARCHIVIUM is successful if:

- The user slows down
- The system feels inevitable
- Trust emerges from clarity
- The interface feels built, not styled
