# ARCHIVIUM — Design Expectations

## Architectural Interface Specification

This document defines the **design ambition**.
It is not safe.
It is not minimal for comfort.
It is intentionally demanding.

---

## Visual Tone

The interface must feel:

- Heavy
- Calm
- Authoritative
- Precise

No friendliness.
No warmth.
No playfulness.

This is a serious system.

---

## Color & Contrast

- Near-black backgrounds (#0B0B0C range)
- Bone / parchment whites (#F4F1EC range)
- Occasional mineral accents (oxidized copper, concrete gray)

Contrast is high.
Color is rare.
When color appears, it must justify its existence.

---

## Typography as Architecture

### Primary Typeface

Cormorant Garamond

- Large sizes
- Tight tracking
- Editorial, almost monumental

### Secondary Typeface

Space Mono

- Codes
- Labels
- Meta-information
- Technical data

Typography must create hierarchy without containers.

Text floats in space, anchored only by alignment.

---

## Grid System

- Strict multi-column grid (12–16 columns)
- Visible vertical rhythm
- Horizontal rules as structural beams

Grid lines may appear on scroll, hover, or transition.
The user should sense the underlying system at all times.

---

## Layout Behavior

- Extreme use of white space
- Asymmetry within strict rules
- Content never centered without reason

The interface breathes.
Nothing is crowded.
Nothing is accidental.

---

## Motion & Interaction

Motion is restrained but physical.

- Slow easing
- Heavy inertia
- Transitions feel like mass moving

Examples:

- Sections slide as planes
- Content reveals vertically, like unrolling blueprints
- Hover states displace elements subtly (1–4px max)

No bouncy effects.
No elastic motion.
No playful easing.

---

## Imagery Treatment

Images are:

- Desaturated
- High contrast
- Often cropped aggressively

Full-bleed images are rare and intentional.
Most images live within the grid, respecting margins.

Images must feel archival, not promotional.

---

## Data Presentation

Properties are presented as **records**, not cards.

- Tabular layouts
- Clear typographic hierarchy
- Metadata prioritized over visuals

Icons are avoided.
When necessary, they are geometric and minimal.

---

## Navigation Philosophy

Navigation is spatial, not menu-driven.

- Vertical depth
- Horizontal traversal
- Clear sense of position

Breadcrumbs may behave like coordinates.

---

## Emotional Outcome

The user should feel:

- Small, but safe
- Guided, but not manipulated
- Inside a system that will outlast them

If the design feels impressive but slightly intimidating,
it is working.
