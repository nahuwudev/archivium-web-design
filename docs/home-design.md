# ARCHIVIUM — Home Blueprint

## Architectural Interface Specification

This document defines **what the home must demand from design and assets**.
It is intentionally strict.

---

## Global Requirements

- Strict multi-column grid (12–16 columns)
- Extreme white space
- No centered layouts without justification
- Motion is physical, slow, restrained

---

## Section 01 — Hero / Archive Plane

### Concept

The home opens inside a living architectural document.

---

### Required Assets

#### 1. Abstract Architectural Plans

Format:

- SVG preferred
- Thin strokes
- No recognizable buildings
- Inspired by cadastral maps and sections

Usage:

- Full-viewport background
- Extremely slow drift (30–60s loop)
- Independent axis movement (X or Y only)

These assets establish the system _before_ content appears.

---

### Typography

Primary Statement (Canela):

> Real Estate  
> as Digital  
> Infrastructure

- Large scale
- Left-aligned to grid
- Broken lines with intention

Secondary Copy (Söhne):
Short explanatory sentence.  
No marketing language.

---

### Motion — Signature Effect

**Structural Drift**

- On scroll, planes and text desync by 2–4px
- Grid lines move at different speeds
- Everything returns to axis after interaction

The system bends.  
It never breaks.

---

## Section 02 — The System

### Layout

Three vertical architectural blocks.

Each block contains:

- Title (Canela)
- One sentence (Söhne)
- One technical diagram
- One code annotation (IBM Plex Mono)

Example:

ARCHIVE  
Records, not listings.  
[diagram]  
ASSET::TYPE::0193

---

### Required Assets

#### 2. Modular Diagrams

Format:

- SVG
- Geometric primitives only
- Lines, rectangles, coordinates

Usage:

- Visual explanation
- Section separators
- Structural ornaments

---

## Section 03 — Archive Preview

### Concept

Assets are records, not cards.

---

### Layout Rules

- Tabular alignment
- No shadows
- No cards
- No rounded corners

Each asset displays:

- Code
- Typology
- Status
- Year
- Location

Images are optional and secondary.

---

## Section 04 — Navigation as Space

### Philosophy

Navigation behaves like spatial traversal.

---

### Interaction

- Horizontal transitions between sections
- Breadcrumbs behave like coordinates
- Position is always clear

No dropdown menus.
No playful interactions.

---

## Motion Guidelines

- Slow easing
- Heavy inertia
- No elastic motion
- No bounce

Motion should feel mechanical and deliberate.

---

## Emotional Outcome

The home should feel:

- Serious
- Calm
- Slightly intimidating
- Trustworthy

If the user feels they entered a system that will outlast them,
the design succeeded.
